Topos library for Pure Data

## Pure Data externals for gesture analysis
The Topos Library is a collection of Pure Data abstractions 
that help in the development of real-time interactive systems dealing with
high-level analysis of human movement. 

The library was developed for dance and music gesture control 
and was used in several artistic works. For more information,
go to http://naveda.info/topos.

Check the tutorials: https://github.com/naveda/Topos-Tutorials

The library was presented to the public in the paper

[1]L. Naveda and Santana, Ivani, “‘Topos’ toolkit for pure data: 
exploring the spatial features of dance gestures for interactive musical applications,” 
in Proceedings of the 40th International Computer Music Conference (ICMC) / 11th Sound & Music
Computing conference, Athens, Greece: University of Athens, 2014.

## How does it work?

You can use Synapse, Osceleton or any other source of 3d position data as input.

See the tutorials.

## Installing

 Just put it in your Pure Data path by using Pure Data's methods or by using the object [declare -path topos]
